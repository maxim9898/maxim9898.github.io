### The Pragmatic Programmer
Reading through chapter 1 I one of the first things that catches my eyes is that pragmatic programmers take charge of their own career paths and aren't afraid of ignorance or error. Seeing how I've been programming for a while now it's come to my attention that this statement is true, that every programmer will experience this whether its failure with their code or something else there's always going to be errors in programming and that I find is very true. Another thing that caught my eye when reading through the chapter was that we need to fix any "broken windows" we come by as it can't be left for later. These windows in the long run might hurt you the programmer in the end so as soon as any error comes up a solution needs to be found. I so far in the programming world haven't experienced much for when it came to customers and their needs for a product so my expectation for when working for people I'm not to certain on making the program I'm writing to be great, but not in perfect condition as won't that make the customer not totally satisfied? Another thing that I questioned when reading chapter one was when it had told you not throw away the painting that you've been working on, because in my opinion sometimes in order for me to go into another direction I'll need to completely delete all of the code that I've written so far.

Experimenting with diffrent platforms and enviroments can help strengthen a programmer. I really agree with this as it'll give every programmer an understanding on how other machines operate possibly helping you in a future project with someone else working on a diffrent machine or platform. Building a network will also benefit a programmer building him or her better connections with diffrent people. I feel that as a programmer it's very important for people to communicate with one another no matter what project they're working on as it can give you a better understanding on what the project is and what outcome is expected.

Overall reading through chapter one of The Pragmatic Programmer I've realised that all the points listed need to be applied as it can help me prepare for the real world that comes after graduation. Many programmers don't expect this kind of behaviour as they're accustomed to their own lifestyle, but in the end looking at the points I've made it'll only benefit a programmer working on a project.

### Why I'm taking Software Engineering?
As I'm a computer science major this is one of my required courses in order for me to attain the diploma when I graduate. I really look forward to getting a lot more hands on experience for when it comes to software development in the real world as it'll give me a better understanding on how most of the world runs on computers. I hope to also cover software security as it'll give me a better understanding on how security works online.
Overall, I hope to get a better understanding on how software systems work in the real world and that by the end of the course I'll be able to get a better feel myself. I hope to gain more knowledge on how softwares work from this course applying it to the real world and everday use.

### What Software Engineering means to me
In today's world almost everythign revolves around technology and the demand for Software Engineers is growing as well. Software Engineers today play an important role when it comes to developing softwares for example: Emails, Video Games, and Websites. Any technology that is contact with a computer or mobile system has to designed by someone like a Software Engineer. These Engineers make sure the system runs properly and smoothly so that the customer is happy with the product. Not only do they they maintain how the software works, but these engineers also design them. Software Engineers play a huge role in our society that many people don't realize it, but if they hadn't existed then possibly most of the tehcnolgy that we possess today simply wouldn't exist without them. 

I personally view Software Engineers as a high priority in today's society seeing how they play such a huge role when it comes to the influence they have. Watching the world evolve at rapid rate and the demand for more Software Engineers continues to grow more companies are trying to distinguish or grow on the internet today, seeing how it's the main source of communication we have today.
