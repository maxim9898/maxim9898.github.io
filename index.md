### Why I'm taking Software Engineering?
As I'm a computer science major this is one of my required courses in order for me to attain the diploma when I graduate. I really look forward to getting a lot more hands on experience for when it comes to software development in the real world as it'll give me a better understanding on how most of the world runs on computers. I hope to also cover software security as it'll give me a better understanding on how security works online.
Overall, I hope to get a better understanding on how software systems work in the real world and that by the end of the course I'll be able to get a better feel myself. I hope to gain more knowledge on how softwares work from this course applying it to the real world and everday use.

### What Software Engineering means to me
In today's world almost everythign revolves around technology and the demand for Software Engineers is growing as well. Software Engineers today play an important role when it comes to developing softwares for example: Emails, Video Games, and Websites. Any technology that is contact with a computer or mobile system has to designed by someone like a Software Engineer. These Engineers make sure the system runs properly and smoothly so that the customer is happy with the product. Not only do they they maintain how the software works, but these engineers also design them. Software Engineers play a huge role in our society that many people don't realize it, but if they hadn't existed then possibly most of the tehcnolgy that we possess today simply wouldn't exist without them. 

I personally view Software Engineers as a high priority in today's society seeing how they play such a huge role when it comes to the influence they have. Watching the world evolve at rapid rate and the demand for more Software Engineers continues to grow more companies are trying to distinguish or grow on the internet today, seeing how it's the main source of communication we have today.
