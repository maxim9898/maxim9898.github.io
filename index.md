### What Software Engineering means to me
In today's world almost everythign revolves around technology and the demand for Software Engineers is growing as well. Software Engineers today play an important role when it comes to developing softwares for example: Emails, Video Games, and Websites. Any technology that is contact with a computer or mobile system has to designed by someone like a Software Engineer. These Engineers make sure the system runs properly and smoothly so that the customer is happy with the product. Not only do they they maintain how the software works, but these engineers also design them. Software Engineers play a huge role in our society that many people don't realize it, but if they hadn't existed then possibly most of the tehcnolgy that we possess today simply wouldn't exist without them. 

I personally view Software Engineers as a high priority in today's society seeing how they play such a huge role when it comes to the influence they have. Watching the world evolve at rapid rate and the demand for more Software Engineers continues to grow more companies are trying to distinguish or grow on the internet today, seeing how it's the main source of communication we have today.
